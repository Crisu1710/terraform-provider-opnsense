### Read-Only

- `domain` (String) If a domain is entered here, queries for this specific domain will be forwarded to the specified server.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether this route is enabled.
- `server_ip` (String) IP address of DNS server to forward all requests.
- `server_port` (Number) Port of DNS server, for usual DNS use `53`, if you use DoT set it to `853`.
