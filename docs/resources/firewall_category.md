## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Enter a name for this category.

### Optional

- `auto` (Boolean) If set, this category will be removed when unused. This is included for completeness, but will result in constant recreations if not attached to any rules, and thus it is advised to leave it as default. Defaults to `false`.
- `color` (String) Pick a color to use. Must be a hex color in format `rrggbb` (e.g. `ff0000`). Defaults to `""`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) UUID of the resource.
