# OPNsense Provider

The OPNsense provider is used to interact with resources (only) supported by
the OPNsense API. This provider does not, and will not, support resources
not currently supported by the OPNsense API. If required, see if
[dalet-oss/opnsense](https://github.com/dalet-oss/terraform-provider-opnsense)
will support your needs.

The provider needs to be configured with the proper API credentials before it can be used.

## Getting Started

To generate the API key & secret, follow the
[OPNsense docs](https://docs.opnsense.org/development/how-tos/api.html#creating-keys).
These can then be used to configure the provider.
